# Large-Csharp-Project
This is a large project done by me and two other team members.
The project was a windows application that would use a now inactive microsoft azure SQL server all based in C#.
The project was the idea of creating a reservation system for both businsses and customers. It would allows customers to create reservations
to bussinesses that were on a list generated by any bussiness that would sign up for the service. Then bussineses could see all reservations
then email customers that the bussiness was ready for them.
